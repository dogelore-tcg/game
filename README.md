# Cooky Studios' "Dogelore: The Card Game"
------
This repository is for our code in DLTCG.

## For Developers:

- Example files that other programmers should see as an example input or framework should go in `/devex`
- Features/Scripts that are in development by a programmer go in `/indev`
- Features/Scripts that are completed and ready to be added to the Unity project go in `/comp`
- Resources (like images) that programmers should have to use/test your scripts go in `/res`
- Deprecated/Unused features will go in `/depr`. Try not to delete stuff, as they might come in handy later
- If you need help with something and/or are not skilled enough to do it, reach out in the chat on Discord, and try to submit and issue to allow for easier tracking of your problem

## IMPORTANT
ON HOLD, POSSIBLY COMPLETELY CANCELED! Do not expect frequent or even any updates!
